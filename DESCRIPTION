Package: ggphylo
Title: Tools for laying out and plotting phylogenetic data
    (trees and alignments) with ggplot.
Description: ggphylo is a set of functions for producing expressive
    visualizations of phylogenetic data using ggplot. Its main features
    include plotting a tree alongside its alignment and using tree
    annotations to modulate visual elements of the plot (e.g. line width,
    node size). Various convenience methods are also included for working
    more easily with ape's phylo objects.
